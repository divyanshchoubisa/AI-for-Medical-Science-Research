# Hippocampal Volume Quantification in Alzheimer’s Progression
</br>

Hippocampus is one of the major structures of the human brain
with functions that are primarily connected to learning and memory.
The volume of the hippocampus may change over time, with age,
or as a result of disease. In order to measure hippocampal volume,
a 3D imaging technique with good soft tissue contrast is required.
MRI provides such imaging characteristics, but manual volume
measurement still requires careful and time consuming delineation
of the hippocampal boundary. <br/>
In this project, you will go through
the steps that will have you create an algorithm that will help
clinicians assess hippocampal volume in an automated way and
integrate this algorithm into a clinician’s working environment. First,
you’ll prepare a hippocampal image dataset to train the U-net based
segmentation model, and capture performance on the test data.
Then, you will connect the machine learning execution code into a
clinical network, create code that will generate reports based on
the algorithm output, and inspect results in a medical image viewer.
Lastly, you’ll write up a validation plan that would help collect clinical
evidence of the algorithm performance, similar to that required by
regulatory authorities.
